				Hi there! My name is Nils and I'm a high school student who loves coding in my free time.
				I've always been interested in computers and technology, and programming has become a
				passion of mine over the years.<br /><br />
				One of my favorite programming languages is Rust. I find Rust to be a powerful and efficient
				language that's well-suited for systems programming and other low-level tasks. I also appreciate
				Rust's focus on safety and security, which makes it a great choice for building reliable and
				robust software.<br /><br />
				Aside from coding, I also enjoy playing my instruments: clarinet and saxophone. Music has always
				been a big part of my life, and I find that playing my instruments helps me unwind and stay creative.<br
				/><br />
				When I'm not coding or playing music, I enjoy exploring new technologies and learning more about
				computer science. I'm particularly interested in areas like artificial intelligence, machine
				learning, and cybersecurity, and I hope to continue studying these fields in the future.<br
				/><br />
				Thanks for stopping by and getting to know me a little better! If you have any questions or just
				want to chat about coding, music, or anything else, feel free to reach out.<br />
