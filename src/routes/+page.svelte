		<h2>Hi, there!</h2>

		<p>
			I'm Nils, a high-school <code>Rust</code> enthusiast passionate about coding. I've worked on
			various projects so far, so look for that under
			<a href="/projects" class="link">Projects</a>. Additionally, you can also
			<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/nwrenger" class="link" target="_blank">
				sponsor me on GitHub
			</a>
			to support my work and to get some cool perks like early access to certain projects. Nevertheless,
			feel free to reach out for a chat about coding or anything else!

		<h3>Skills</h3>
		<p>
			My focus is on UI development (websites, apps, and TUIs) and performance-driven projects like
			algorithms and databases. Therefore, my proficiency lies in <code>Rust</code> and
			<code>Svelte</code>
			(i.e., <code>JavaScript</code> / <code>TypeScript</code>). But in the past,
			I've experimented with programming languages like <code>Go</code>, <code>Zig</code>,
			and <code>Python</code>, and even delved into game development with <code>Godot</code>
			â€” proving that I bring a diverse, adaptable skill set to every project!
